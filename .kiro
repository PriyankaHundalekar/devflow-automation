# DevFlow Automator - Kiro Hero Week 2 Challenge

## Project Overview
**"I hate doing repetitive dev tasks, so I built this Swiss Army knife"**

DevFlow Automator is a comprehensive CLI tool that tackles multiple developer pain points in one unified solution. Instead of building separate tools for each task, this project combines the most annoying developer workflows into a single, AI-powered automation suite.

## The Problem
As developers, we spend countless hours on repetitive tasks:
- Writing the same commit messages over and over
- Manually updating README badges when they break
- Setting up identical project structures
- Tracking coding time across projects
- Keeping documentation in sync with code changes
- Writing boilerplate code for common patterns

## The Solution
DevFlow Automator uses AWS Bedrock AI to intelligently automate these workflows:

### 🤖 AI-Powered Commit Messages
- Analyzes git diffs using Claude AI
- Generates conventional commit messages
- Learns from your code changes

### 🏷️ Smart Badge Management  
- Auto-detects GitHub repository info
- Updates README badges automatically
- Supports build status, version, license, and more

### ⏱️ Intelligent Time Tracking
- Auto-detects current project context
- Tracks active coding time with file watching
- Provides detailed productivity analytics

### 🚀 Environment Bootstrapper
- One-command project setup for Python, Node.js, React, FastAPI
- Creates complete project structure with best practices
- Initializes git repository and dependencies

### 🏗️ Code Generation
- AI-powered boilerplate generation
- Pre-built templates for common patterns
- Custom code generation from natural language

### 📚 Documentation Sync
- Extracts function signatures from code
- Generates API documentation using AI
- Keeps README in sync with code changes

## Technical Implementation
- **Language**: Python 3.8+
- **AI Provider**: AWS Bedrock (Claude 3 Haiku)
- **CLI Framework**: Rich for beautiful terminal output
- **File Watching**: Watchdog for real-time tracking
- **Git Integration**: GitPython for repository operations

## Unique Features
1. **Unified Interface**: All tools accessible through single CLI
2. **AI-First Approach**: Uses AWS Bedrock for intelligent automation
3. **Context Awareness**: Auto-detects project type and structure
4. **Real-time Monitoring**: File watching for active time tracking
5. **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux

## Installation & Usage
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up AWS credentials in .env file
# Run any module
python devflow_automator.py <module> [options]

# Examples:
python devflow_automator.py commit          # AI commit messages
python devflow_automator.py badges all     # Update all badges
python devflow_automator.py track start    # Start time tracking
python devflow_automator.py setup python   # Bootstrap Python project
```

## Impact
This tool addresses the "death by a thousand cuts" problem in developer productivity. While each individual task might only take a few minutes, they add up to hours of lost productivity per week. DevFlow Automator reclaims that time and mental energy for actual coding.

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with more AI models
- Custom workflow automation
- Team collaboration features
- IDE extensions
- Cloud deployment automation
